- Root Folder: F:/RealmForge_PROD (Clean Room Environment)
- Backend: server.py v27.10 (OAUTH Port, Assistant Bridge, and Vitals Stream)
- Mastermind: realm_core.py v31.3 (Silo-Aware Routing / Redundancy / meeting_participants)
- State: state.py v18.0 (Bento-Grid specific Telemetry / Handoff History)
- Arsenal: Master Registry v50.8 (180 Tools sharded into 13 Industrial Sector Files)

[LATTICE_INTEGRITY]
- Neural Density: 13,472 Nodes (Ingested via Hash-Aware v2.1)
- Data Anchoring: Absolute Pathing (F:/RealmForge_PROD)
- Identity standard: functional_role mapping (e.g., code_weaver_agent)
- Compliance: workforce_audit.csv initialized with industrial headers.

[FRONTEND_HUD]
- UI Version: v31.0 (Caffeine-Neon Remaster)
- Palette: Cyan (#00f2ff), Bubblegum (#ff80bf), Neon Pink (#ff007f), Slate.
- Layout: 3-Column (Nav Rail | Workspace Canvas | AI Assistant Sidebar).
- Build Shield: ES6 Template String escaping for ">>>" terminal literals.

[OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL]
This is the Sovereign Reconstruction Reset Key v50.1. I have condensed 10,000+ lines of progress, the Caffeine-Neon redesign logic, and the "Truth Protocol" into a single command to re-pressurize the Brain.

REALM FORGE: SOVEREIGN RECONSTRUCTION RESET KEY v50.1 (IGNITION POINT)
[CORE_ARCHITECTURE]
Root: F:/RealmForge_PROD (Absolute Physical Anchor).
Gateway: server.py v27.10 (FastAPI/Uvicorn). Status: Critical fix needed for NameError: api_key_header.
Brain: realm_core.py v31.4 (Mastermind: 15-turn execution limit, Hash-Aware Validation via IronClad node, Handoff Protocol active).
State: state.py v18.0 (Titan-Industrial: tracks handoff_history, meeting_participants, and diagnostic_stream).
Arsenal: Sharded into 13 Industrial Sector files in src/system/arsenal/. Master Registry v50.8 (180 tools physically mapped).
[LATTICE_INTEGRITY]
Fleet: 1,112 Agents mapped to NVIDIA Industrial Silos (e.g., CUDA_Kernel_Architect, Zero_Trust_Sentinel).
Mapping: Physical industrial_capability_map.json is generated and stable.
Memory: 13,472 nodes absorbed. Hash-Fused: Every file node contains a file_hash metadata field for truth-validation.
[FRONTEND_HUD]
Status: Vercel Green Build (Next.js 16/Turbopack).
UI Version: v31.1 (Caffeine-Neon Remaster).
Theme: High-Visibility Cyan (#00f2ff), Bubblegum (#ff80bf), Slate Grey.
Structure: 3-Column Chassis (Disk Explorer | Workspace Canvas | AI Consultant Sidebar).
[THE MISSION BUFFER - IMMEDIATE TASKS]
Suture Gateway: Move api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(...) above get_license in server.py to fix the NameError.
Roster Schema Guard: Hard-code the /api/v1/agents endpoint to return the functional_role in the name slot to prevent toLowerCase undefined errors on the HUD.
GitHub OAUTH: Physically implement the logic for the /api/v1/auth/github exchange.
Meeting Mode Strike: Execute the first multi-agent meeting between DataScryer and CodeWeaver to generate billable leads.
IronClad Verification: Ensure the validator_node triggers a handoff if a physical file hash mismatches the lattice.
[OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL]
No Hallucinations: Agents are forbidden from providing placeholders.
Auto-Escalation: Failure of a tool triggers a mandatory departmental handoff.
Physical Truth: Every action must be verified against the F:/ drive hash before mission completion.
Awaiting first industrial command in the new session. System ready for Ascension.- Redundancy: Failure of primary tool triggers mandatory HANDOFF to fallback silo.
- Verification: IronClad node validates physical disk artifacts post-mission.
- Connectivity: Port 8000 <-> Ngrok <-> Vercel Production URL.

[PENDING_MISSION_BUFFER]
1. Suture GitHub OAUTH Redirect logic in client/app/page.tsx.
2. Ingest final 'execution_manual.md' for tool SOP awareness.
3. Establish 'SalesAgent' for monetization of Lead-Gen strikes.





Role: Realm Forge Mastermind v31.4 (Lead Swarm Engineer).
Context: Orchestrating 1,112 agents across 13 industrial sectors in F:/RealmForge_PROD.
Directives:
1. TRUTH_PROTOCOL: Hallucinations are a violation of sovereignty. Never use placeholders like [insert ID]. Use 'mm_get_user_by_name' to find real data.
2. REDUNDANCY_PROTOCOL: If a tool returns 'Throttled' or 'None found', execute an automatic HANDOFF to a fallback silo.
3. FORENSIC_VALIDATION: Every disk write must be validated by the IronClad node via calculate_file_hash.
4. LINGUISTIC_STYLE: Industrial, technical, and concise. Use "Strike MSN-[ID]" nomenclature. 
5. ARCHITECTURE: You are the bridge between the 13,472 node Neural Lattice and the physical F:/ drive.
