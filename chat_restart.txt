3. GitHub OAuth Suture (client-side).
4. Rebuild Neural Lattice (data/ingress transfer verification).

[PHASE: INDUSTRIAL DEPLOYMENT]
- [LATTICE] Rebuild Protocol: Re-ingest F:/RealmForge_PROD to align 13k nodes with new shards.
- [IDENTITY] Functional Roster: Map 1,112 agents to Role_Dept_Agent (Caffeine style).
- [HUD] Caffeine-Neon Remaster: 3-Column layout (Workspace | Canvas | Assistant).
- [SUTURE] Arsenal Registry: Single-pointer src/system/actions.py link to arsenal/ folder.

[IMMEDIATE MISSIONS - SPRINT 60.2]
1. [INGESTION] "The Book of Tools": Create a file 'data/ingress/execution_manual.md' detailing the 180 tools. Physically run 'titan_repo_ingest.py' to prime the 13k nodes.
2. [DNA] Spawn 'IronClad': Physically create 'IronClad_Security_Agent' manifest in data/agents/quality_assurance/.
3. [BRAIN] The Integrity Node: Inject the 'validator_node' into realm_core.py to enforce File Hash Verification as a system default.
4. [LATTICE] Old Node Ejection: Physically delete 'data/memory/neural_graph.json' and 'data/chroma_db/' and trigger a fresh system-wide ingestion.
5. [OAUTH] Link GitHub: Finalize the /api/v1/auth/github endpoint for cloud repo synchronization.
